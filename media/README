This folder contains somewhat ephemeral things: subfolders serve as
MEDIA_ROOT for `demo` and `development` environments. The media/demo
directory should always exist and not be deleted, though its contents
can be. The media/development.$$ (where $$ is the PID of the running
process) directories are created and destroyed by tests, as needed.
