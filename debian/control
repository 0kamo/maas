Description: Ubuntu MAAS Server
 Ubuntu MAAS Server is the successor to Orchestra. It offers a
 nice UI to provision your Ubuntu servers. Each physical server
 (“node”) will be commissioned automatically on first boot.
 During the commissioning process administrators are able to
 configure hardware settings manually before an automated smoke
 test and burn-in test are done. Once commissioned, a node can
 be deployed on demand by name, or allocated to a queue for
 dynamic allocation to services being deployed on this MAAS.
