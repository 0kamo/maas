Description: Treat a group of physical servers as a cloud-like resource to be allocated on demand.
 Each physical server (“node”) will be commissioned automatically on first boot.
 During the commissioning process administrators are able to configure hardware
 settings manually before an automated smoke test and burn-in test are done.
 Once commissioned, a node can be deployed on demand by name, or allocated to a
 queue for dynamic allocation to services being deployed on this MAAS.
