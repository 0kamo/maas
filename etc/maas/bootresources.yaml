## Boot image download configuration.

boot:
  ## Marker: this configuration has not been initialised yet.
  #
  # If this is set to True during installation or a later upgrade, it means
  # that this configuration file has not been edited by a human or by MAAS
  # itself.  When you edit this configuration to suit your needs, be sure to
  # remove this setting, or change it to False, so that a future upgrade will
  # know not to overwrite the configuration file.
  #
  # If the setting is True, the upgrade procedure will look for downloaded
  # boot images that predate the current, Simplestreams-based import
  # mechanism, and rewrite the configuration based on what it finds.  The new
  # configuration will import the new-style equivalents of the images that
  # were imported in the old setup.
  configure_me: True

  ## Storage location for boot images.
  #
  # These images can get quite large: some files are hundreds of megabytes,
  # and you may need multiple copies for different architectures, OS releases,
  # etc.
  storage: "/var/lib/maas/boot-resources/"

  ## Sources of downloadable boot images.
  #
  # Each source downloads from one simplestreams URL, though it is possible to
  # have multiple sources using the same URL.  For example, if you want to
  # download "release" images for one OS release and just the "beta-2" images
  # for another, specify two separate selections.  Otherwise, the importer
  # would have to download both kinds of images for both releases.
  sources:
    - path: "http://maas.ubuntu.com/images/ephemeral-v2/daily/"
      keyring: "/usr/share/keyrings/ubuntu-cloudimage-keyring.gpg"

      ## Filters for this source's imports.
      #
      # Be careful: these items will multiply.  For example if you specify
      # architectures "i386" and "amd64", and subarchitectures "generic",
      # "hwe-s", and "hwe-t", the import script will need to import 6 images,
      # for each possible combination.  If you only want some of those
      # combinations, keep them as separate sources and/or selections.
      selections:
        - release: "trusty"
          arches: ["i386", "amd64"]
          subarches: ["generic"]
        - release: "precise"
          arches: ["i386", "amd64"]
          subarches: ["generic"]
      #selections:
      #  - release: "*"
      #    arches: ["*"]
      #    subarches: ["*"]
## other source example:
#    - path: "http://hyperscale.ubuntu.com/images/"
#      selections:
#        - release: "*"
#          arches: ["*"]
#          subarches: ['*']
