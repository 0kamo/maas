# Legacy configuration file for the maas-import-ephemerals script.
#
# This file is obsolete, but the script will still read it for compatibility.
# Configure /etc/maas/pserv.yaml by preference.

## Include settings from import_pxe_files.
[ ! -f /etc/maas/import_pxe_files ] || . /etc/maas/import_pxe_files

# These options can be defined here, although for future compatibility they
# should be set in pserv.yaml instead:

#DATA_DIR="/var/lib/maas/ephemeral"
#ARCHES="amd64/generic i386/generic"

# The 14.04 release of MAAS can only enlist/commission using Ubuntu 14.04
# (Trusty Tahr) ephemeral boot images.  The ephemeral images are quite large,
# much larger than the install images, so there is little point downloading
# them for older releases.
